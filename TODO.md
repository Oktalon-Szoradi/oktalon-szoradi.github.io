---

- Bug Fixes
  - **Bold = Fix "done", in testing phase**
  - [ ] Blink (Chromium)
    - [x] Favicon doesn't work????
    - [ ] My logo looks jagged/weird. Antialiasing issue?
    - [ ] `/#/projects`: Oxygen icon applications-education-university.svg
                         looks weird. Maybe same issue as above?
    - [ ] **Alignment of component NavigationButtons**
    - [ ] **Alignment of component CopyToClipboard**
    - [ ] Brave desktop: Sometimes not the entire view gets updated??
  - [ ] Webkit (Safari)
    - [ ] Download [PNG|JPG] button icon's underline collides with arrow point;
          Find an actual icon
  - [ ] On pages with side navigation, able to be shown on mobile in landscape,
        but too big to fit vertical space!
- School Projects
  - [ ] Content from HTL 5CHITM (2023/2024)
    - [x] Blender (3D) Project
    - [ ] [Maybe] MEDT Audio/Video Project

  - [ ] **Stuff I link to on YouTube**
        **(use instead of Discord|MEGA|MediaFire|GoogleDrive)**
    - [x] Uploaded! Now replace links across sites
          YouTube Playlist descriptions weren't edited, else formatting would
          break, as line breaks are no longer accepted
    - [ ] Consider uploading other big files to also Mega|MediaFire|GoogleDrive
  - [ ] [Maybe] Make page about Tetris Stardust / Feevo
- Other
