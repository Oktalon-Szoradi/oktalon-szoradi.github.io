# To Do

This is a personal To-Do-List for my website.

---

- Bug Fixes
  - **Bold = Fix "done", in testing phase**
  - [ ] Blink (Chromium)
    - [ ] My logo looks jagged/weird. Antialiasing issue?
    - [ ] `/#/projects`: Oxygen icon applications-education-university.svg
                         looks weird. Maybe same issue as above?
    - [ ] **Alignment of component NavigationButtons**
    - [ ] **Alignment of component CopyToClipboard**
    - [ ] Brave desktop: Sometimes not the entire view gets updated??
  - [ ] Webkit (Safari)
    - [ ] Download [PNG|JPG] button icon's underline collides with arrow point;
          Find an actual icon
  - [ ] On pages with side navigation, able to be shown on mobile in landscape,
        but too big to fit vertical space!
- School Projects
  - [ ] Content from HTL 5CHITM (2023/2024)
    - [ ] Blender (3D) Project
    - [ ] [Maybe] MEDT Audio/Video Project
    - [ ] [Maybe] Audio Archive PWA

  - [ ] Graphic Designs!
    - [ ] Iconography
    - [ ] Skeuomorphic/Glossy concepts
    - [ ] HQ (vector) recreations of stuff
  - [ ] Other repos I have? Like `eu-linux-locale` perhaps
  - [ ] **Stuff I link to on YouTube**
        **(use instead of Discord|MEGA|MediaFire|GoogleDrive)**
    - [x] Uploaded! Now replace links across sites
          YouTube Playlist descriptions weren't edited, else formatting would
          break, as line breaks are no longer accepted
    - [ ] Consider uploading other big files to also Mega|MediaFire|GoogleDrive
  - [ ] [Maybe] Make page about Tetris Stardust / Feevo
- Other
  - [x] Reformat my gear specs, especially when I get my Framework laptop
  - [ ] [Maybe] Explaining my music tastes
