# To Do

- Stopwatch:
  - [x] Show time since last lap when lapping
- Timer:
  - [x] Allow changing tone maybe? to some locally provided file
  - [ ] Hours Minutes Seconds label a bit too squished? Space further apart
- Desk Clock:
  - [ ] Figure out how to get the time to not get vertically cut off when screen
        is too narrow
  - [x] Fullscreen mode
  - [x] Better time zone selector
    - [ ] Use arrow icons instead of →
    - [x] REFACTOR THE CODE!!
- Etc.:
  - [x] Add general settings page to change touch sound to alternative, credits,
        maybe even themes in the future?
  - [x] Make some animations smoother
