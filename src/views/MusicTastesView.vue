      "What music do you listen to?" is a question I don't know how to answer.
      So instead, I'll just show people this section here lol
      <p>
        Y'know, I bet the YouTube algorithm knows what kind of music I listen
        to. Unfortuantely it's not an
        <AbbreviationMobile title="Artificial Intelligence">
          AI </AbbreviationMobile
        >&nbsp;<AbbreviationMobile title="Large Language Model">
          LLM </AbbreviationMobile
        >, so I can't just ask it in plain language (like you would with
        Chat<AbbreviationMobile title="Generative Pretrained Transformer"
          >GPT</AbbreviationMobile
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't really have a favorite artist or musician/composer or singer or
        one single genre. It's kind of complicated to [try to] explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I could just, in summary, say that I just like music that I
        [happen to] like?
      </p>
      <p>
        YouTube does have these "Recaps" thingies, playlists of music videos I
        listened to often during some time (usually 3 months?). So, up until
        now, but only a couple recent times [I've been asked this question], I
        just showed the asker one of these playlists. Though, it still doesn't
        feel comprehensive to me. Like, the playlist doesn't completely show
        everything I listen to; it doesn't feel like it fully captures my music
        taste(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, which I feel like it's noteworthy enough to write here for
        some reason (i.e. worth mentioning): For some reason I feel… embarrased?
        when e.g. showing someone that YouTube playlist; so, when trying to tell
        someone (explain to them) what I listen to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I think my music taste(s) is(are) unique, I mean, I've never met
        anyone yet who's music taste(s) is(are) like mine. I also feel like I'm
        quite different than everyone else. Well, I mean, that is also true in
        quite a few other areas. But for music, it seems like everyone has some
        favorite artist on Spotify or something. I… don't. Also I don't use
        Spotify lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I'm going to list stuff here. There's quite a lot, it's not 100%
        all/everything, but most of it. I think it's exhaustive enough.
      </p>

      <h2>Music without lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        I'd say I usually listen to music without lyrics, actually. So, not
        songs. Instead, themes or soundtracks.
      </p>
      For instance, <b>Nintendo music</b>, like:
      <ul>
        <li>Console system music (GameCube, DSi, Wii, 3DS, Wii U)</li>
        <li>
          as well as music from some first-party Wii channels (like, the
          shopping (e.g. eShop) channels too)
        </li>
        <li>and <b>video games</b>, like Wii Sports [Resort] for example</li>
        <li>
          Music from Super Mario games (as well as
          <b>fan-made tracks, covers, restored/remastered renditions, YTPMVs</b
          >; which I also like in general, not exclusive to of Nintendo)
        </li>
        <li>
          and some from Kirby and a few from The Legend of Zelda, though it's
          mostly Mario (also including Mario Kart, Paper Mario, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      And other <b>video game music</b>, like:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ace Attorney; and that

        <li>The Impossible Game</li>
        <li>Some of Geometry Dash's tracks</li>

        <li>Color World [Origins] (e.g. Gliding Thoughts by Dan Phillipson)</li>

          Rally X, Mappy, Phoenix, Tower of Druaga
        </li>
        <li>Jingles: Arkanoid, Bosconian, Galaga, Xevious</li>
      </ul>
      And of course some <b>non-&lt;video game&gt;</b> music:
      <ul>
        <li>Some music you'd hear on YouTube back then, like:</li>
        <li>Dreamscape - 009 Sound System</li>
        <li>Pas de Deux - Bird Creek</li>
        <li>
          The Time Machine - Alan Parsons Project (heard this on a video about a
          Dutch railroad crossing,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKbk_Zkkk3c" target="_blank"
            >ADOB NC Bilthoven 2 by @DutchTrainChannel</a
          >)
        </li>
        <li>
          Also whatever song is played in this video:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oNTVvbaETk" target="_blank"
            >Czech Level Crossing by @kurvjuh</a
          >; it sounds like some MIDI? I can recognize that default soundfont
          Windows uses
        </li>
        <li>Rainbow Tylenol - Kitsune^2</li>
        <li>
          Probably just because of nostalgia. Like, also some of the tracks
          played in the FitnessGram Pacer Test, e.g.:
        </li>
        <li>Balearic - Garry Judd, Pendle Poucher, Nick Ryan</li>
        <li>Groove Ride - Pete Stanford</li>
        <li>
          And, of course, some stuff I heard while playing RŌBLOX back then:
        </li>

          Outrun the Nightmare (Composed by Manny Greetz; Produced by Glenn
          Anthony Guerrier)

        </li>
        <li>MSN TV 2's connecting theme</li>
        <li>
          Some background tracks in some cartoons, like Spongebob Squarepants.
          I'm also familiar with that old Pink Panther cartoon. Also: The Super
          Mario Bros. Super Show, The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, Super
          Mario World
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>Kurzgesagt's soundtrack (by Epic Mountain)</li>
        <li>3Blue1Brown's soundtrack (by Vincent Rubinetti)</li>
        <li>
          Some tracker/chiptunes, like Toilet Story 4 by Ghidorah, Mortimers
          Chipdisko by Mirtimer Twang (this I found out about from
          <a href="https://www.supertux.org/" target="_blank">Super Tux</a>),
          <br />
          The Penis (Eek!) - surasshu (some time ago this song got associated
          with some art of Silly Cat ("Boykisser"), art originally being by
          Mauzymice)
        </li>
        <li>Night of Nights - COOL&CREATE/beatMARIO</li>

          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Music with lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        I'd regard myself as not-really-a-song-listener, if that makes any
        sense. The stuff here is kinda oddly specific. Well, most of it.
      </p>
      I think YouTube is quite responsible / played a big role in some of my
      music discoveries
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stayin' Alive - Bee Gees<br />
          &rightarrow; Purely due to this YouTube video of a cat:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNvYcgICPCs" target="_blank"
            >Cat is feeling alive. by @BlackWolf-vp2zh</a
          >
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Smooth Criminal - Michael Jackson</li>
        <li>Billie Jean - Michael Jackson</li>
        <li>
          Thriller - Michael Jackson<br />
          &rightarrow; Smooth Criminal due to the internet, e.g. there was a
          video of an Ace Attorney animation of the characters bopping to this,
          there's some memes splicing parts of this song ("you've been hit by,
          you've been struck by, …"), and there's a video layering the GameCube
          startup jingle over the song, which happens to fit quite well.<br />
          Billie Jean and Thriller I don't remember. I think I had a look at
          some of his other songs because of Smooth Criminal
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Give It All You've Got - Brian Wade, Oswin John Falquero, Tony Cliff
        </li>
        <li>Sweet Victory - David Glen Eisley, Bob Kulick</li>
        <li>
          I Wanna Rock - Twisted Sister / Goofy Goober Rock - Tim Rothrock, Jim
          Wise<br />
          &rightarrow; Because of Spongebob. Give It All You've Got was played
          for a couple seconds in just one episode. It's where Mr. Krabs
          enslaves jellyfish, he listens to this track while on an exercise
          bike. (S2E19a - "Jellyfish Hunter")
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Paralyzer - Finger Eleven</li>
        <li>Bodies - Drowning Pool</li>
        <li>Hey There Delilah - Plain White T's</li>
        <li>The Final Countdown - Europe</li>
        <li>Blue (Da Ba Dee) - Eiffel 65</li>
        <li>Dragostea Din Tei - O-Zone</li>
        <li>Caramelldansen - Caramell / Supergott</li>
        <li>Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley</li>
        <li>Scatman (ski-ba-bop-ba-dop-bop) - Scatman John</li>
        <li>Scatman's World - Scatman John</li>
        <li>Through The Fire And Flames - DragonForce</li>
        <li>One-Winged Angel - Final Fantasy VII</li>
        <li>You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) - Dead Or Alive</li>
        <li>
          Don't Stop Me Now - Queen<br />
          &rightarrow; I heard these across the internet back then. Mostly on
          YouTube. Some also on RŌBLOX.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Drunken Sailor - Irish Rovers<br />
          &rightarrow; Because of Spongebob, I guess lol
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen</li>
        <li>
          Erika<br />
          &rightarrow; At least the first one, our history teacher in HTL played
          it, I think. Purely from music alone, these are not bad. Of couse, the
          theme/meaning/moral/association/etc. I do not agree with; those are
          bad.
        </li>
        <li>
          Red Sun in the Sky<br />
          &rightarrow; I heard this on some random memes/videos on YouTube.
          Again, like with the above, I don't agree with Mao Zedong propaganda
          or whatever, I'm just seeing it from a purely musical perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sat Tee Touy (Cambodian Folk Song)<br />
          &rightarrow; One time my friend sent me this, I think it gained
          traction by someone for some reason associating this song with Pol Pot
          (again, I don't agree with what he did). However, this song doesn't
          actually have anything to do with him. It's about animals doing drugs
          or something lol.
        </li>
        <li>
          Zeven Dagen Lang / Was Sollen Wir Trinken - Bots<br />
          &rightarrow; I saw this on the recommended column on YouTube while on
          one of the videos for Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen, I think.
          It was the German one and for some reason had a military image. This
          song actually seems to be Dutch, though.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ved Stanford Brua - Harald Foss<br />
          &rightarrow; I think I heard this in one of those "Stereotypical Music
          Around The World" videos.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Happy - Pharrell Williams<br />
          &rightarrow; I think I heard this once in a middle school? I don't
          remember.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Bad Apple!! - ZUN<br />
          &rightarrow; Quite popular on YouTube. "If it can display 2 colors, it
          can play Bad Apple". The English and German versions others have made
          are also cool.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Dubidubidu - Christell<br />
          &rightarrow; Some time ago this song got associated with some art of
          Silly Cat ("Boykisser"), art originally being by Mauzymice. It also
          got associated with a GIF of a cat bopping its head to the music.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          here comes the sun - Bill Wurtz<br />
          &rightarrow; He's known for "history of the entire world, i guess" and
          some other things. I like his songs too.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Still Alive - Portal</li>
        <li>
          Want You Gone - Portal 2<br />
          &rightarrow; Portal is a game I like, and their music and songs are
          cool too!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          HelloWorld.java - Nanowar of Steel<br />
          &rightarrow; A friend sent this to me once, and hahaha I really like
          this lol
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
