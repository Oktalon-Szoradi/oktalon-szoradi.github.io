# web-touchwiz-clock

Recreation\* of the default Clock app found on old Samsung devices with the
TouchWiz UI using HTML, CSS, and JS.

I'll be using the Clock app (com.sec.android.app.clockpackage) found on the
Samsung Galaxy Rush (SPH-M830) for reference.

\*Not a 1:1 recreation:

- Alarms is not impplemented
- World Clock is not implemented
- Timer is a teensy bit different; also can't set alarm tone nor volume
- Desk Clock is very different
