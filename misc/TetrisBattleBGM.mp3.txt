From the Tetris Battle files. At some point in the past I downloaded an archive
of it all, and I actually still have the original RAR file. I don't remember
where I got it from, though. If you want me to send it to you, contact me.

Its file name is: Tetris Battle.rar
Its file size is: 15353929 bytes (14.6 MiB)
Its SHA-256 checksum is: 351e86349d946e8cd60fbaecc553e9f4091a52f82c064a82d5a48a70f74c945e

Inside the archive, this file is in:

/songs/BattleMp.mp3
