Some time in the past I downloaded an archive of the tetrisfriends.tetrisdev.com
site and it had game data relating to "Tetris Connect":

/data/games/TetrisConnect/data/help.swf
Sprites 97 and 191

Game data does not seem to be on Notris Foes

For more information, see the Feevo.txt file in this same directory.
