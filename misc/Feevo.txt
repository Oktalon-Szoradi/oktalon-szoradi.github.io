A game that seems like it may have been the precursor to Feevo is
"Tetris Connect", which was going to be on Tetris Friends.

Data is stored in this location:

/data/games/TetrisConnect

at least in the tetrisfriends.tetrisdev.com archive I got some time in the past.
I don't remember where I downloaded it from and I no longer have the original
archive file, just the extracted contents.
