# Hello, World!

This is my first GitHub repository. Also my very first GitHub Pages site.

The website links to some stuff made by me, so I guess this is my homepage!

#### ToDo:

##### Content Additions:

- **School Projects:**
  - Audio Project page\*
  - Maybe IT-Projekte gallery
  - Maybe Medientechnik - Design gallery
  - Content from this year (2023/2024)
- **Personal Projects:**
  - My own SoundTrap songs (e.g. Tetris themes)
  - My guideline to setting up Windows
  - Graphic Design
    - Iconography
    - HD remasters (Windows 7 wallpaper, Aero window)
    - more...

##### Changes:

- Make smaller images for thumbnails for galleries to increase performance\*
- Group things under School Projects (maybe add a sort of timeline style)
  - Maybe also add submenus in the navbar?
- Migrate to Vue.js and SASS\*\*

### \*\* New "Infrastructure"

I'm planning to migrate to using **Vue.js and SASS**, as so far everything has been vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; aka it's all manual.

Doing this will make updating my website more easier and faster. I just need to figure out how to make it work with GitHub Pages.

I think after I set up the page for my audio project that I did last year and fixing gallery performance (see the ToDo entries marked by an \*), I'll begin to migrate/convert.

Unrelated note:    
There's so much content under School Projects, and only Tetra Legends Ultimate under Personal Projects. This is... deceptive, at least that's how I feel. I have sooo many Affinity Designer designs that are really cool which I'd like to showcase.    
Just thought I'd mention that.

Fun Fact:    
The message for this commit (the one for me updating this `README.md`) is generated using GitHub Copilot!
