# Production / Live Page

This repo is what gets hosted by GitHub pages!

What follows are notes for me.

---

When running `npm run build`, the contents of the `dist` directory should be
here.

## Updating

In most cases, index.html and the `assets` directory need to be replaced (delete
the old `assets` directory first before putting in the new one).
