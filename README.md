# Hello, World!

This is my first GitHub repository. Also my very first GitHub Pages site.

The website links to some stuff made by me, so I guess this is my homepage!  
Check it out here:

## 2025-07-08: Welcome Vue.js!

Breaking changes! I've migrated to Vue. The old website's source code is
available in the `legacy` branch.

The `main` branch (this one) will now only serve for the source code. The `dist`
that's actually hosted is in the `gh-pages` branch.

Wanna check out the commit history for when I was building the new Vue site,
check out:

Thank you for visiting!&emsp;:3

### `/src/assets/TalonLogo/`

This directory/folder contains my logo. Please don't use my logo in bad faith
(e.g. to impersonate me). You may obviously still fork this repo and do what you
want with it provided you follow the GPLv3 (and follow the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
license for media), but if you want to use my website
as the base for yours, don't use my logo on your production/hosted page. I
recommend removing my logo from your fork, but if you leave it in, it's okay.

### `/public/misc/`

This folder contains stuff I've linked to in YouTube, especially Discord CDN
links, as without a browser extension like
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fix-discord-cdn/>,
you'll just see "This content is no longer available.".
License(s) here is(are), if not described in the additional information file,
unknown.

The additional information file contains additional information about a
specific file, such as where I got it from. The naming convention is as follows:

For example, for a resource named

```text
resource.mp3
```

The additional information for this file would be in the file named

```text
resource.mp3.txt
```

So, just append `.txt`
