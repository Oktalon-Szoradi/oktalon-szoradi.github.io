# Hello, World!

This is my first GitHub repository. Also my very first GitHub Pages site.

The website links to some stuff made by me, so I guess this is my homepage!  
Check it out here:

## 2025-07-08: Welcome Vue.js!

Breaking changes! I've migrated to Vue. The old website's source code is
available in the `legacy` branch.

The `main` branch (this one) will now only serve for the source code. The `dist`
that's actually hosted is in the `gh-pages` branch.

Wanna check out the commit history for when I was building the new Vue site,
check out:

Thank you for visiting!&emsp;:3
