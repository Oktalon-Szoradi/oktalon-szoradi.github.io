            <h2>Hey Vsauce, Random Here</h2>
            <p><b>Teacher's grade: 9/10</b></p>
            <p>
              Here we had to pick a video with people speaking and replace the
              voices with our own. You could repeat the original script, but
              it was encouraged to change it up a bit. Either by translating,
              or by making a parody. I chose the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted the lip movements to still look natural, but at the
              same time try to make the script funny. I'm not really satisfied
              with the script, but I didn't have time to make a better one.
              The goal here was to practice synchronizing audio anyway. So, I
              guess it's fine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our audio laboratory had a small little "room" for recording,
              that had special soundproofing walls. We borrowed a real
              microphone (H4n) and used that. Time was running short so I
              didn't do many takes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used Adobe Premiere Pro to synchronize the audio, then I used
              Shotcut to finalize the video. I also used vocalremover to
              extract the music, since I couldn't get the original music.
            </p>
            <p>
              I almost turned it in just in time, but then got interrupted. By
              the time I came back to my laptop, I got graded 0/10. I turned
              it in really quickly and wrote a message to the teacher. He was
              kind enough to change it to 9/10. But then later we were allowed
              to improve our projects anyway. I adjusted the audio a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was actually also planning to imitate the classic intro: "Hey
              Vsauce, Michael here!", but I didn't have time for that-
